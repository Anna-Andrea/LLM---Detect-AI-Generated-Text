[Kaggle Cometitions: LLM - Detect AI Generated Text](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/overview) 

Summary:

● Built an LSTM model using the KearsNLP library to identify whether text was generated by GPT. The LSTM model can accept text sequences as input, and the model includes embedding layers, LSTM layers, fully connected layers, etc.

● Model by using different pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, DebertaV 3, etc.), data enhancement, optimizing network architecture and number of layers, learning rate scheduling, hyperparameter optimization, adding Dropout layers, trying different word embeddings, etc. Optimize and improve the versatility and accuracy of the model.

● This model has a large improvement compared to the baseline (based on LR, SGD and NB Bernoulli's voting).
