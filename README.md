[Kaggle Cometitions: LLM - Detect AI Generated Text](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/overview) 

Summary:
Implemented an AI Generated Text detect model using KearsNLP, improved model performance by several methods, including trying different pre-trained models (BERT, RoBERTa, DebertaV3), data augmentation, trying different model architectures and layers, learning rate scheduling, hyperparameter tuning, adding Dropout layers, trying different word embeddings, etc.
